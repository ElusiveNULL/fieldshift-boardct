Add OVW instruction
  - Would be difficult to optimize
Add SKL instruction
  - Most complex instruction by far
Add SPT instruction
  - Simplest of the yet unimplemented instructions
Implement auxiliary communication
  - Handling rule breakage disputes would be tough:
    - Would require checking for rule breakages
    - And remembering them for the next turn
    - But discarding them afterwards
Add input type handling
Add support for STDEX and STDEX Type-A rulesets
  - Not sure how to go about implementing this
